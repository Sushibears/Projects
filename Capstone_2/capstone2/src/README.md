**** *-*-*-*-* ** BASEMENT BEAT DOWN ** *-*-*-*-* ****
 ~ ~ ~
 Masil is ready to go out & meet with her friend today, she grabs all her stuff but as prepares to go out she remembers something...
    Her friend's nacklace!
 She promised to give it back when she was finished with it, and notices it's not in her purse.
 She searches around the house, but it's not anywhere in her room, the kitchen...
 She's only gone out once with it on, and she definately brought it back home.
 So where is it....
 ....... Is it in the basement?
 That is where she remembered having it last....but it hasn't been cleaned in a while...

 Basement Beat Down is a text only, turn based game by Akiah Garland.
 Survive without Masil's Lives reaching 0 and you'll win the game!

 You play the game by pressing the number key related to the menu option you want to choose.

 For example, if you wanted to ATTACK, and your menu choices are ..
 "1 - ATK | 2 - RUN"
 You'd press the 1 key on your keyboard.

 The game only functions by choosing a number on your keyboard. Excluding the beginning screen (after telling the player the story.) 
 Putting in words, letters, etc. will prompt the game to ask you to make a proper selection. 

- Room Functions -

  No two rooms in the basement are the same, and you'll have different menu options based on the room you're in.
  
  In a room where you face bugs, you have the following choices, which do the following actions -
  1 - ATK: Attack all the bugs. If you lose the fight you lose a life, so be careful!
  2 - RUN: Run away from the bugs. You have a high chance of getting away from there, but there is a chance that the bugs catch & attack Masil!

  For rooms that only contain boxes, the menu options & related actions are -
  1 - OPEN A BOX: Open a box. This could contain a potion (restores 1 life), or a bug (lose a life).
  3 - KEEP GOING: Leave the room without opening any boxes.
  You can only open one box in the room.

  For rooms where you are ambushed by monsters, the menu options & related actions are -
  1 - FIGHT: Attempt to fight the bugs in the room. Like the battle room, you have a chance of either beating all the bugs OR getting beat up. 
  2 - RUN: Attempt to run away from the bugs. You have a chance of either escaping sucessfully (take 0 damage) or getting caught (take damage).

  Once a room is completed, you'll move on to the next room.
  Carefully weigh your options so Masil doesn't faint!
